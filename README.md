This Markdown file includes badges for visual appeal, tables for organized timelines and resources, and stylized text for easy reading. HTML and CSS can be used within GitHub Markdown files, but they have limitations and might not always render as expected directly in the README.md file. This structure should give a comprehensive guide to anyone following the IBM TW108 course and preparing for certification exams under the `Cyber Retaliator Solutions Organisation`.
